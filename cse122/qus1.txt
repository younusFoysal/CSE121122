Qus: Describe the limitations of using getchar and scanf 
functions for reading strings.

Ans:

1. By using getchar we can read only one character from the keyboard.
So we canâ€™t read the full string.

2. The limitation of scanf function is that it terminates its input on the first white space it finds.
A whitespace is included with blanks , tabs ,carriage returns , form feeds and new lines.
